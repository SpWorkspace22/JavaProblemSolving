You are given a pointer/ reference to the node which is to be deleted from the linked list of N nodes. The task is to delete the node. Pointer/ reference to head node is not given. 
Note: No head reference is given to you. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the linked list.

N = 2
value[] = {1,2}
node = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: After deleting 1 from the
linked list, we have remaining nodes
as 2.


Solutuion:

class Solution
{
    void deleteNode(Node del)
    {
         // Your code here
         
        del.data = del.next.data;
        del.next = del.next.next;
         
    }
}
