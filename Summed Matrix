A matrix is constructed of size n*n. such that Mi,j= i+j. Count the number of cells having value q.
Note: Assume, the array is in 1-based indexing.

Input:
n = 4, q = 7
Output:
2
Explanation:
Matrix becomes
2 3 4 5 
3 4 5 6 
4 5 6 7
5 6 7 8
The count of 7 is 2.

Solution:
class Solution {
    static long sumMatrix(long n, long q) {
        // code here
        if(q > 2*n){
            return 0;
        }
        
        if(n>=q){
            return q-1;
        }
        
        return (2*n-q+1);
    }
};
