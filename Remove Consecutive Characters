Given a string S. For each index i(1<=i<=N-1), erase it if s[i] is equal to s[i-1] in the string.

Example 1:

Input:
S = aabb
Output:  ab 
Explanation: 'a' at 2nd position is
appearing 2nd time consecutively.
Similiar explanation for b at
4th position.


Solution :

class Solution{
    public String removeConsecutiveCharacter(String S){
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        char visited = '\0';
        
        for(char c: S.toCharArray()){
            if(visited!=c){
                sb.append(c);
                visited = c;
            }    
        }
        
        return  sb.toString();
    }
}
