Sansa has an array. She wants to find the value obtained by XOR-ing the contiguous subarrays, followed by XOR-ing the values thus obtained. Determine this value.

Example

def sansaXor(arr):
    # Write your code here
    if len(arr) % 2 == 0:   
        return 0
    else:
        result = arr[0]
        for idx in range(2, len(arr), 2):
            result = result ^ arr[idx]
        return result
