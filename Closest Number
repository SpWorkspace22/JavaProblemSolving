Sorting is useful as the first step in many different tasks. The most common task is to make finding things easier, but there are other uses as well. In this case, it will make it easier to determine which pair or pairs of elements have the smallest absolute difference between them.

Example

Sorted, . Several pairs have the minimum difference of : . Return the array .

Note
As shown in the example, pairs may overlap.

Given a list of unsorted integers, , find the pair of elements that have the smallest absolute difference between them. If there are multiple pairs, find them all.

Function Description

Solution:

class Result {

    /*
     * Complete the 'closestNumbers' function below.
     *
     * The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.
     * The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY arr as parameter.
     */

    public static List<Integer> closestNumbers(List<Integer> arr) {
    // Write your code here
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        Collections.sort(arr);
        
        int smallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size()-1;i++){
            if(Math.abs(arr.get(i)-arr.get(i+1))<=smallest){
                smallest = Math.abs(arr.get(i)-arr.get(i+1));
            }
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size()-1;i++){
            if(Math.abs(arr.get(i)-arr.get(i+1))==smallest){
               result.add(arr.get(i));
               result.add(arr.get(i+1));
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

}
