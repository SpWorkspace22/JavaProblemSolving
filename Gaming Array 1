Andy wants to play a game with his little brother, Bob. The game starts with an array of distinct integers and the rules are as follows:

Bob always plays first.
In a single move, a player chooses the maximum element in the array. He removes it and all elements to its right.

Solution:

def gamingArray(arr):
    # Write your code here
    count = 0
    bigger = 0
    for i in arr:
        if i > bigger:
            bigger = i
            count=count+1
            
    if count % 2 == 0:
        return "ANDY"
    
    return "BOB"
